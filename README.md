### Xcake:labs Website

This is a Github Pages site that has been automatically generated. Its purpose is to serve as a placeholder until we get a chance to put in an actively updatable structure. 

If you want to add more pages here, just add them as [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) markdown style in the repo, and when you push to master, it will be processed automatically. Awkward part is where you need to test it locally - you'll have to install Jekyll to convert your markdown and connecting links, partials, etc, into a local static site for viewing.
